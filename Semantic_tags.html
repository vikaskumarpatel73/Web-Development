   <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
   <summary>You can prompt for as much input as you need in each pass through a while
    loop. Let's make a polling program in which each pass through the loop 
    prompts for the participant's name and response. We'll store the data we 
    gather in a dictionary, because we want to connect each response with a 
    particular user</summary>
